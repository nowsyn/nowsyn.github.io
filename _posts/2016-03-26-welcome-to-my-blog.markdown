This is my first blog. I am learning Git, which is sooooooo fantastic! I have found that many programmers favorite Ruby. They claim that it is elegant and interesting. Really? I am getting down to it. I'm interested in many topics such as OS, CV, AI and so on. Howerver, just interested until now. I haven't spent time on any of them. Oh, God, what am I doing?!

Ok, don't worry, now is the best. Let's spare no efforts to contribute to CS!

Thanks!
